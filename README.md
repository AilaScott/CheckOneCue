# CheckOneCue
 An open source audio cue player for theatre, dance, and corporate AV.

 CheckOneCue is in pre-alpha.  The basic functions (a list of files, spacebar playback, adjustable fades with the esc key) are all working and relatively stable.  The fade-in function is not yet working.

 ## FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT
 
 These are the features I would like to add in the future:

 ### Fade-in feature
 ### Support for .aif files
 ### Looping w/ ability to adjust loop points
 ### Save/Load show from .xml
 ### Sample Color Coding
